                    <li>Domestic adoption: Adopting a child within one’s own country.</li>
                    <p>Domestic adoption refers to the situation where a child who is resident in Ireland 
                        is adopted by a person or couple who is/are also resident in Ireland. The nature 
                        and effect of an Irish adoption order is that the child becomes the child of the 
                        adopter(s) as <br>if born to them, with all the rights and duties of parent(s) and children 
                        in relation to each other. <br>Please note that Irish adoption legislation only allows for the 
                        adoption of a child. A child is defined as a person who has not yet reached eighteen years of 
                        age. It is not possible for a person eighteen years of age or older to be adopted in Ireland. <br>
                        There are four different types of domestic adoption – stepfamily, extended family/relative adoption, 
                        domestic infant adoption and long term foster care to adoption.</p>
